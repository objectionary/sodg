//! This is a memory structure with vertices and edges between them,
//! which we call Surging Object DiGraph (SODG), because it expects
//! modifications comping from a user (through [`Sodg::add`],
//! [`Sodg::bind`], and [`Sodg::put`]) and then decides itself when
//! it's time to delete some vertices (something similar to
//! "garbage collection"). For example, here is how you create a simple
//! graph with two vertices and an edge between them:
//!
//! ```
//! use sodg::Sodg;
//! let mut sodg = Sodg::empty();
//! sodg.add(0).unwrap();
//! sodg.add(1).unwrap();
//! sodg.bind(0, 1, "foo").unwrap();
//! ```
